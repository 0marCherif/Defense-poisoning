Let's break down why this rewrite is effective:

*   **Cuts unnecessary fluff:** It removes verbose phrases like ""have emerged as powerful models,"" ""attractive,"" and ""in this paper, we show that.""
*   **Focuses on the core finding:** The main contribution is the new, stronger guarantee (""Tighter generalization guarantees hold"").
*   **Summarizes the improvements:** It explicitly states the key improvements over prior work: ""without the curse of dimensionality or restrictive assumptions.""
*   **Maintains technical precision:** It accurately uses the key technical term ""Wasserstein distributionally robust estimators.""
*   **Condenses to one sentence:** It successfully combines all the key points into a single, clear, and concise sentence."
